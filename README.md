Here's my small collection of models from computational statistics. 


### Density Estimator 
[Link to code.](https://github.com/robaleman/computational-statistics/blob/master/Density-Estimators.R)
Includes kernel density estimation with cross validation and box kernel (histogram) density estimation.

### Kernel Smoother
[Link to code.](https://github.com/robaleman/computational-statistics/blob/master/Kernel-Smoothing.R)
Includes kernel smoothing for one- and two-dimensions, additive modeling with backfitting algorithm, and cross validation.

### Ridge Regression
[Link to code.]
Includes ridge regression.
